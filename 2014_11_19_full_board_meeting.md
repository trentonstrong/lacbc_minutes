### (6:45 PM)

- Jen: Nothing unusual in financial reporting.

## Firefly Ball Report - Kelly Martin (6:50 PM)

- Steve: Would like Kelly and Greg's impression of Firefly ball.

- Kelly: Very pleasantly surprised with attendance at Firefly ball, day of attendance was around 230.
  Event proceeds were net $13000, very good for a first year event.  Search for major sponsor should begin earlier next year.
  Event planner performed well and should be considered for future events.

- Greg: Identifying and securing honorees who can deliver on obligations should be prioritized in the future.  Industry and civic contacts should be the highest priority for honorees.

  **ACTION ITEM** (Development): Add LA Mart, LA Center Studios to list of possible event spaces for 2015.

## El Grande Fondo Report - JJ (7:00 PM)

- JJ: Event went well.  Contract with Forest Foundation for $20,000 for our services.  Last year was cancelled due to lack of permitting.
  Costs were low, net proceeds were $3000 with attendance of 74.  Event was kept intentionally small this year for safety reasons.  Forest service limits total ridership to 300.
  Price should be increased next year.

- **ACTION ITEM** (Development): Should research liability concerns for the event.

  Steve: Annual plan would assist greatly in synchronizing and coordinating asks for sponsors and donations throughout the year.

- Greg: Is this the only time of year that we can do this ride?  The overlap with Firefly Ball is unfortunate in terms of duplicate asks.

  Eric: How much were soft costs related to the event

  JJ: Soft costs were factored in to the contract amount in the scope of work.  

## Climate Ride Update - Greg (7:30 PM)

- Greg:  2014 was the second year of Climate Ride for LACBC.  Our share of the proceeds will be $45,000.  Our goal next year is 20 riders and a target raise of $100,000.
  Support will be required from the organizations via incentives and assistance in raising money.  An pre-ride event to meet Team LACBC for donors over a certain amount is a possibility.
  A split benefitting local chapter riders is a possibility as well, as long as invested resources are recoup'd pro rata.

## Upcoming Events (7:40 PM)

- Steve:  Board meeting on Wednesday, December 17, 2014.

- Jen: Open house is Thursday, December 4, 2014.

## Executive Director Search Update (7:40 PM)
