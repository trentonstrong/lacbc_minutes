## Results of Ad-Hoc Committee on Policies of Association, Vote on Proposal (7:42 PM)

- Steve: Some board members volunteered to form policies of association and a statement of tolerance to guide those policies.

- Steve: Statement should be a mandatory handout at LACBC events.

- Many board members: Statement should be amended with language concerning alignment with LACBC guiding principles and agendas of non-aligned organizations so we have a policy to not associate with certain groups.

- Greg: Policy or protocol to not associate with groups could be a separate item.

- Steve: Discretion of whether to associate on a per-event basis should reside with the Exective Director.

## Planning Department Funding (8:26 PM)

- Jen: This is not a concern simply for planning department funding only.  A grant initiative was intended to last for 4 terms is being cancelled at the end of this term.  This affects our HEEL initiative, Safe Routes to Schools initiative, and multiple staff members.

- Greg: What is the annual funding?

- Jen: About $135,000 a year.

- Jen: Issue to replace a portion of the lost budget should not be tied to the specific initiatives.
